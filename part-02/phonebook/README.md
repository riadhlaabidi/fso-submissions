This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Getting Started

First, install dependencies, from the project root run:

```bash
npm install
```

This app has `json-server` installed to provide data for the react app, to start the server and the client seperatly you could run:

```bash
npm run server
```

and then in another terminal tab run the client:

```bash
npm start
```

or you can alternatively run both concurrently, as the project already contains the concurrently library as a dev dependency and a script for running both apps:

```bash
npm run dev
```
